# Lesson 2.2: Strings

# Strings are sequences of characters that are enclosed in quotes.
# We can enclose them with single or double quotes and assign them
# to variables. We can even combine strings by adding them (we call
# this concatenation).

print 'Hello'
print "Hello"

hello = "Howdy"
print hello

# Add your own code and notes here

# A string is just a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. We can use 'single' or "double quotes". 
# The only requirement is that the start quote must be that same as the end quote.
# It doesn't matter if you use single or double quotes.
# We don't want variables to start with capital letters, it's just a convention.


# Lesson 2.2: Hello!!!

# Define a variable, name, and assign to it a string that is your name.

name = 'Tom Mault'
print 'Hello' + name + '!'

# You cannot concatenate (add) a string and a number. You can multiply a string by a number. This will replicate the string X times.
